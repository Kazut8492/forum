just need two steps to start.
1. You gotta open two terminal windows and use `cd` command to respectively go to backend and frontend folder.
2. In backend folder, `go run main.go`
3. In frontend folder, `npm start`
4. You will be guided to `http://localhost:3000/`

Let me know if you got any question!
