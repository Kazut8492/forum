just need two steps to start.
1. You gotta open two terminal windows and use `cd` command to respectively go to backend and frontend folder.
2. In backend folder, `go run main.go`
3. In frontend folder, `npm start`
4. You will be guided to `http://localhost:3000/log-in`
5. You can use dummy user accounts to log in, or you can register a new account.
   Username: DummyUser1
   Password: DummyPassword1
------------------------------
   Username: DummyUser2
   Password: DummyPassword2
------------------------------
   Username: DummyUser3
   Password: DummyPassword3

Let me know if you got any question!
